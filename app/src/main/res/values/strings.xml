    <string name="rules">Checkers is played by two opponents, on opposite sides of the game board.
        One player has the green pieces; the other has the white pieces. Players alternate turns.
        A player may not move an opponent\'s piece. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to
        an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent\'s piece, and
        the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the
        game) by jumping over it. Only the dark squares of the checkered board are used. A piece may
        move only diagonally into an unoccupied square. When presented, capturing is mandatory in
        most official rules, although some rule variations make capturing optional. The player
        without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game.</string>
